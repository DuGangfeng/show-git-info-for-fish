# show-git-info-for-fish

This is a function coded in fish language. You can copy it into you ~/.config/fish/config.fish(for the default fish configuration file location) and restart your shell. 

Then you can see changes when there is a git repository in your current path:
- green repository branch name
- red x if there is changes without being added
- yellow + if there is changes without being committed
- purple ? if there is new files without being tracked
